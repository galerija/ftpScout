Description
===========

ftpScout is a [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) file watching module that provides automatic ftp upload (using [node-ftp](https://github.com/mscdex/node-ftp) module) and optional minification of .js and .css files using [uglify-js](http://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) and [sqwish](http://github.com/ded/sqwish). It currently only supports ftp protocol.

It requires ftpScoutConfig.json file to work properly. You can use ftpScout's "init" method to start step by step dialog to create it.

**This module is in alpha state. It should be stable, but you are strongly advised to backup any files before using it. You should do a manual backup, which is the safest. Optionally you can also use ''ftpScout backup'' method to create backup of all remote files on the watch list or use ''ftpScout watch --b'' to backup a remote file before it is being updated.**
